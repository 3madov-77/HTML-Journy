                <p><strong>A</strong> computer hacker is any skilled computer expert who uses their technical knowledge
                    to overcome a problem.
                    While "hacker" can refer to any skilled computer programmer, the term has become associated in
                    popular culture with a "security hacker" someone who, with their technical knowledge, uses bugs or
                    exploits to break into computer systems.<strong>You can <a

                <p> <strong>C</strong>rackers are hackers with malicious intentions. They often steal, exploit, and sell
                    data, and are usually motivated by personal gain. Their work is usually illegal. A cracker is like a
                    black hat hacker,[13] but is specifically someone who is very skilled and tries via hacking to make
                    profits or to benefit, not just to vandalize. Crackers find exploits for system vulnerabilities and
                    often use them to their advantage by either selling the fix to the system owner or selling the
                    exploit to other black hat hackers, who in turn use it to steal information or gain royalties.

                    <h3>The first mention of evil “black-hat” hackers :</h3>
                    In 1983, a year after William Gibson brought the word “cyberspace” to the world, we witnessed the
                    first black-hat hackers attack. Kevin Poulsen, also known as “Dark Dante,” hacked the Arpanet
                    network (which was split in the military and public networks for the first time that same year) and
                    was arrested. He was only 17 years old, so he could not be imprisoned for his act.
                    Only a year later, the world has experienced the first viruses. Fred Cohen was behind them. In 1984,
                    however, Bill Landreth, also known as The Cracker, was convicted of hacking the computer system and
                    gaining access to NASA and US Department of Defense data. <strong>You can <a
