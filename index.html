                    <p><strong>A</strong> computer hacker is any skilled computer expert who uses their technical
                        knowledge
                        to overcome a problem.
                        While "hacker" can refer to any skilled computer programmer, the term has become associated in
                        popular culture with a "security hacker" someone who, with their technical knowledge, uses bugs
                        or
                        exploits to break into computer systems.

                    <p> <strong>C</strong>rackers are hackers with malicious intentions. They often steal, exploit, and
                        sell
                        data, and are usually motivated by personal gain. Their work is usually illegal. A cracker is
                        like a
                        black hat hacker,[13] but is specifically someone who is very skilled and tries via hacking to
                        make
                        profits or to benefit, not just to vandalize. Crackers find exploits for system vulnerabilities
                        and
                        often use them to their advantage by either selling the fix to the system owner or selling the
                        exploit to other black hat hackers, who in turn use it to steal information or gain royalties.

                        <strong>The first mention of evil “black-hat” hackers :</strong>
                        In 1983, a year after William Gibson brought the word “cyberspace” to the world, we witnessed
                        the
                        first black-hat hackers attack. Kevin Poulsen, also known as “Dark Dante,” hacked the Arpanet
                        network (which was split in the military and public networks for the first time that same year)
                        and
                        was arrested. He was only 17 years old, so he could not be imprisoned for his act.
                        Only a year later, the world has experienced the first viruses. Fred Cohen was behind them. In
                        1984,
                        however, Bill Landreth, also known as The Cracker, was convicted of hacking the computer system
                        and
                        gaining access to NASA and US Department of Defense data.
